# Word-to-Markdown Converter Project Rules

## Document Flow Handling
- When parsing DOCX files, always process document elements in the original document flow order
- Use direct access to document body via `docx._body._body` to preserve element ordering
- Process both paragraphs and tables as they appear in the document rather than processing them separately
- Document structure should maintain the exact ordering of elements from the source document

## Heading Level Detection
- Use a multi-faceted approach to detect heading levels from Word documents
- Check for official heading styles first (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.)
- Look for other common heading styles like Title, Subtitle, etc.
- Analyze font sizes with appropriate thresholds for different heading levels
- Consider text attributes like bold formatting, CAPS, and length as additional heading level indicators
- Preserve the document's hierarchical structure in the converted Markdown

## Formatting Rules
- Use PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Maximum line length of 100 characters
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Comment complex algorithms and logic

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

## File Organization
- Organize code into logical modules based on functionality
- Keep related functionality in the same file
- Separate utility functions into their own modules
- Use __init__.py files to organize package structure

## Code Patterns
- Prefer functional programming approaches where appropriate
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Implement error handling with appropriate try/except blocks
- Use context managers for file operations

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Follow the pipeline architecture for the conversion process
- Implement each component as a separate class with clear interfaces
- Use strategy pattern for handling different content types
- Maintain clear separation between parsing, conversion, and output generation
- Ensure proper error handling and reporting throughout the pipeline

## Testing Approach
- Use a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Create specialized test scripts for complex functionality verification
- Use pytest for unit testing
- Test both individual components and their integration
