# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The Word-to-Markdown converter follows a pipeline architecture with several processing stages:

```
[Input .docx File] → [Document Parser] → [Content Extractor] → [Markdown Generator] → [Media Handler] → [Archive Creator] → [Output .md + ZIP]
```

## Component Relationships
1. **Document Parser**: Reads and parses the Word document structure
2. **Content Extractor**: Extracts text, formatting, images, and tables
3. **Markdown Generator**: Converts extracted content to Markdown format
4. **Media Handler**: Processes and saves images and other media
5. **Archive Creator**: Packages the Markdown file and media folder into a ZIP archive

## Design Patterns
- **Pipeline Pattern**: For sequential processing of the document
- **Strategy Pattern**: For handling different content types (text, images, tables)
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating appropriate content handlers based on element type
- **Visitor Pattern**: For traversing the document structure while maintaining separation of concerns

## Data Flow
1. Load .docx file into memory
2. Extract document structure and content
3. Process each element according to its type
4. Generate properly formatted Markdown
5. Extract and save media files
6. Create output directory structure
7. Package everything into a ZIP archive

## Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation for unsupported elements
- Detailed logging for conversion errors
- Fallback mechanisms for complex formatting
- Validation steps to ensure output consistency
