# Progress

## Current Status
- Architecture design has been completed
- Detailed documentation created in docs/architecture.md
- Input and output files have been analyzed to understand the conversion process
- Ready to begin implementation of document model classes

## What Works
- Project architecture has been defined with clear components:
  - Document model (Document, Paragraph, Image, Table)
  - DocxParser for extracting content from DOCX files
  - MarkdownWriter for generating output

## Conversion Process Analysis
- **Document Structure**:
  - The input docx file contains 183 paragraphs and 2 tables
  - Bold text is used to indicate headings
  - Images are embedded within the document

- **Markdown Output**:
  - Formatted with proper heading structure
  - Images are extracted and referenced with sequential naming
  - Tables are converted with proper column alignment
  - Text formatting (bold, italic) is preserved
  - Double line breaks are used after headings

## What's Left to Build
1. **Document Model**
   - Document class
   - Paragraph class
   - Image class
   - Table class

2. **Parser Component**
   - DocxParser implementation
   - Paragraph extraction and heading detection
   - Text formatting detection (bold, italic, etc.)
   - Image extraction
   - Table parsing

3. **Markdown Writer**
   - Markdown generation
   - Formatting conversion
   - Image handling and storage
   - Table conversion
   - ZIP archive creation

4. **Utilities**
   - Command-line interface
   - File path handling
   - Error logging
   - Testing infrastructure

## Known Issues
- N/A - Development has not yet begun

## Next Milestones
1. **Milestone 1**: Implement document model classes
2. **Milestone 2**: Create basic DocxParser functionality for text extraction
3. **Milestone 3**: Build MarkdownWriter with formatting support
4. **Milestone 4**: Add image extraction and handling
5. **Milestone 5**: Implement table conversion
6. **Milestone 6**: Create archive generation
7. **Milestone 7**: Add error handling and command-line interface
