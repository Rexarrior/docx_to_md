# Progress

## Current Status
- Architecture design has been completed
- Document model classes have been implemented
- DocxParser has been implemented and enhanced to preserve document flow
- Table detection issue has been resolved
- MarkdownWriter has been implemented
- The conversion pipeline is now functional

## What Works
- **Document Model**:
  - Document, Paragraph, Image, and Table classes are implemented
  - All model methods for proper data handling are working

- **Parser Component**:
  - DocxParser successfully parses Word documents
  - Document flow is preserved with correct element ordering
  - Heading detection for bold text works correctly
  - Image extraction is functional
  - Table parsing is implemented with correct positioning
  - Text formatting is preserved

- **Writer Component**:
  - MarkdownWriter successfully generates Markdown content
  - Text formatting is properly converted to Markdown syntax
  - Images are extracted and saved with correct references
  - Tables are converted to Markdown format
  - ZIP archives are created with proper structure

## Parser Analysis Results
- The parser successfully processes the example document
- It identifies headings (36), images (8), and tables (2)
- Tables are correctly positioned in the document flow (at positions 15 and 18)
- Text formatting (bold, italic) is correctly extracted
- All 183 paragraphs are parsed into structured objects
- Document hierarchy and flow are maintained
- The test suite confirms all parser functionality works as expected

## Recent Implementations
- Implemented MarkdownWriter class with proper formatting support
- Added image saving functionality with correct path references
- Implemented text formatting conversion (bold, italic, etc. to Markdown syntax)
- Implemented ZIP archive creation with proper file structure
- Created test script to verify the entire conversion pipeline
- All tests pass with the updated implementation
