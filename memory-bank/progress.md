# Progress

## Current Status
- Architecture design has been completed
- Document model classes have been implemented
- DocxParser has been implemented and tested
- Ready to begin implementing MarkdownWriter

## What Works
- **Document Model**:
  - Document, Paragraph, Image, and Table classes are implemented
  - All model methods for proper data handling are working

- **Parser Component**:
  - DocxParser successfully parses Word documents
  - Heading detection for bold text works correctly
  - Image extraction is functional
  - Table parsing is implemented
  - Text formatting is preserved

## Parser Analysis Results
- The parser successfully processes the example document
- It identifies headings (36), images (8), and tables (2)
- Text formatting (bold, italic) is correctly extracted
- All 183 paragraphs are parsed into structured objects
- Document hierarchy is maintained
- The test suite confirms all parser functionality works as expected

## What's Left to Build
1. **Markdown Writer**
   - Markdown generation
   - Formatting conversion
   - Image handling and storage
   - Table conversion
   - ZIP archive creation

2. **Command-Line Interface**
   - File path handling
   - Error handling
   - Testing infrastructure
