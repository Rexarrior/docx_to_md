# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for the converter
- **python-docx**: Library for reading and parsing Word documents
- **Markdown**: Target output format
- **zipfile**: Built-in Python module for creating ZIP archives

## Development Setup
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.6+ with required dependencies
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management
- **Testing**: Unit tests using pytest
- **Documentation**: README.md with usage instructions and examples

## Technical Constraints
- **Input Limitations**: 
  - Only supports .docx format (not .doc or other formats)
  - Complex formatting may not perfectly convert
  - Custom Word features may not have Markdown equivalents

- **Output Considerations**:
  - Markdown has limited formatting options compared to Word
  - Different Markdown flavors may render the output differently
  - Image paths need to be relative to the Markdown file

## Dependencies
- **python-docx**: For parsing Word documents
- **Pillow**: For image processing
- **markdown**: For validating Markdown output
- **Standard Library**: os, sys, zipfile, re, argparse

## Performance Considerations
- Large documents with many images may require significant memory
- Processing time scales with document complexity
- ZIP compression level can be adjusted based on size/speed requirements
