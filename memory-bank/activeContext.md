# Active Context

## Current Focus
The DocxParser implementation has been improved and now correctly handles tables in the document flow. We've fixed an issue where tables were processed separately from paragraphs, causing them to appear out of order in the parsed document. Our parser now processes all document elements (paragraphs and tables) in the exact order they appear in the DOCX file, preserving the document flow.

## Recent Developments
- Implemented Document, Paragraph, Image, and Table model classes
- Created and tested the DocxParser with TDD approach
- Successfully parsed the example document
- Fixed table detection issue to preserve document flow
- Created special test scripts to verify table positioning
- All tests pass with the updated parser implementation

## Parser Implementation Insights
- Heading detection based on bold text works effectively
- Tables are correctly parsed with rows and columns preserved in proper document flow
- Images are extracted with their binary content
- Text formatting information (bold, italic, etc.) is preserved in runs
- Document structure hierarchy is maintained
- Direct access to document body elements preserves exact ordering

## Current Priorities
1. Implement the MarkdownWriter with basic formatting support
2. Add image saving functionality
3. Implement table conversion to Markdown format
4. Create the ZIP archive packaging
5. Add error handling and command-line interface

## Active Decisions
- **Parser Implementation**: Using python-docx to extract content from DOCX files
- **Document Flow**: Processing paragraphs and tables in order by directly accessing document body elements
- **Heading Detection**: Treating paragraphs with bold text as headings
- **Image Processing**: Extracting and sequentially numbering images
- **Table Processing**: Converting tables to Markdown tables with proper alignment
- **Test-Driven Development**: Using pytest for unit testing the parser

## Next Steps
1. Implement MarkdownWriter class with formatting methods
2. Create text formatting conversion (bold, italic to Markdown syntax)
3. Implement table conversion to Markdown format
4. Add image saving and referencing
5. Create ZIP archive functionality

## Current Conversion Process Insights
- **Document Flow**: Elements are processed in the exact order they appear in the source document
- **Text Formatting**: Bold text in Word is converted to `**bold**` in Markdown
- **Heading Structure**: Bold paragraphs are treated as headings in Markdown
- **Image Handling**: Images from the docx are extracted and referenced in Markdown with the format `![alt_text](image_name.png)`
- **Image Naming**: Images are named sequentially (document.002.png, document.003.png, etc.)
- **Table Conversion**: Tables are converted to Markdown table syntax with proper alignment indicators (`:-)`)
- **Whitespace**: Double line breaks are used after headings and empty paragraphs

## Table Detection Fix
- Fixed the issue with table detection by modifying the parser to process document elements in flow order
- Tables are now correctly positioned in the parsed document structure
- Created specialized test scripts to verify table positions
- Direct access to the document body (`self.docx._body._body`) allows us to process elements in their natural order
- Modified `_process_document_elements` method to handle both paragraphs and tables as they appear
- Test confirmed tables appear at positions 15 and 18 in the parsed document, matching their actual positions in the document flow
