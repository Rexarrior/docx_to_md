# Active Context

## Current Focus
We've enhanced the DocxParser to correctly detect and preserve heading levels from Word documents. Previously, all bold text paragraphs were treated as level 1 headings, but now we can detect various heading levels based on styles, font sizes, and other formatting cues. This improvement ensures the Markdown output correctly represents the document's hierarchical structure.

## Recent Developments
- Implemented Document, Paragraph, Image, and Table model classes
- Created and tested the DocxParser with TDD approach
- Successfully parsed the example document
- Fixed table detection issue to preserve document flow
- Created special test scripts to verify table positioning
- Implemented the MarkdownWriter with full functionality
- Created test scripts to verify the conversion pipeline
- Enhanced heading level detection to properly recognize different heading levels
- Created a test script to verify proper heading level conversion
- All tests pass with the updated implementation

## Parser Implementation Insights
- Heading detection now examines multiple factors:
  - Official "Heading" style names with numeric level indicators
  - Other style names like "Title" and "Subtitle"
  - Font sizes of paragraph text
  - Bold formatting with additional heuristics (ALL CAPS text, text length)
- Tables are correctly parsed with rows and columns preserved in proper document flow
- Images are extracted with their binary content
- Text formatting information (bold, italic, etc.) is preserved in runs
- Document structure hierarchy is maintained
- Direct access to document body elements preserves exact ordering

## MarkdownWriter Implementation Insights
- Text formatting is properly converted to Markdown syntax (bold to **bold**, italic to *italic*, etc.)
- Images are extracted and saved in a media folder, with correct path references in Markdown
- Tables are converted to Markdown using pipe syntax with proper alignment
- Heading levels are properly translated to corresponding Markdown heading syntax (# for level 1, ## for level 2, etc.)
- Document structure is preserved with headings, paragraphs, and other elements
- Special characters are escaped in Markdown to prevent formatting issues
- ZIP archives are created with proper structure, containing the Markdown file and media folder

## Current Priorities
1. Implement error handling for edge cases
2. Enhance the command-line interface
3. Add more comprehensive testing
4. Complete documentation

## Active Decisions
- **Parser Implementation**: Using python-docx to extract content from DOCX files
- **Document Flow**: Processing paragraphs and tables in order by directly accessing document body elements
- **Heading Detection**: Using a multi-faceted approach that considers styles, font sizes, bold formatting, and text properties
- **Font Size Analysis**: Added helper method to extract font sizes from paragraph runs, supporting heading level determination
- **Image Processing**: Extracting and sequentially numbering images
- **Table Processing**: Converting tables to Markdown tables with proper alignment
- **Test-Driven Development**: Using pytest for unit testing the parser
- **Text Formatting**: Converting bold to `**bold**`, italic to `*italic*`, etc.
- **Heading Conversion**: Translating heading levels to corresponding Markdown headings with the appropriate number of # symbols
- **Image Handling**: Saving images in a media folder and referencing them with proper paths
- **Table Formatting**: Converting tables to Markdown using pipe syntax with proper alignments
- **ZIP Structure**: Organizing the output as a Markdown file and a media folder in a ZIP archive

## Next Steps
1. Implement error handling for edge cases (file access issues, malformed documents, etc.)
2. Enhance the command-line interface with better user feedback and options
3. Add more comprehensive testing for different document types and edge cases
4. Complete documentation including usage examples and API reference

## Current Conversion Process Insights
- **Document Flow**: Elements are processed in the exact order they appear in the source document
- **Text Formatting**: Bold text in Word is converted to `**bold**` in Markdown
- **Heading Structure**: Heading levels are detected from styles, font sizes, and formatting attributes
- **Image Handling**: Images from the docx are extracted and referenced in Markdown with the format `![alt_text](image_name.png)`
- **Image Naming**: Images are named sequentially (document.002.png, document.003.png, etc.)
- **Table Conversion**: Tables are converted to Markdown table syntax with proper alignment indicators (`:-)`)
- **Whitespace**: Double line breaks are used after headings and empty paragraphs
- **Image Path Handling**: Images are saved in a media folder and referenced in Markdown using relative paths
- **Document Hierarchy**: All document elements are processed in the order they appear in the source
- **Escape Handling**: Special Markdown characters are escaped to prevent formatting issues
- **Archive Creation**: ZIP archives are created with proper structure for easy distribution

## Heading Level Detection Enhancement
- Enhanced the `_detect_heading_level` method to use multiple approaches for determining heading levels:
  - First checking for official heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.)
  - Looking for other style names like "Title" and "Subtitle"
  - Analyzing font sizes with graduated thresholds for different heading levels
  - Considering text characteristics like case (ALL CAPS) and length
- Added a new helper method `_get_font_size` to extract and normalize font size information
- Created a specialized test script (`test_heading_levels.py`) to verify heading level detection
- Test results confirmed proper heading level distribution in the output markdown
