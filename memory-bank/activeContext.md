# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project architecture has been defined and documented in docs/architecture.md. I've analyzed both the input docx file and the output markdown file to understand the conversion process in detail. I have a clear understanding of how docx elements (paragraphs, text formatting, images, tables) are mapped to markdown syntax.

## Recent Developments
- Reviewed the requirements in docs/task.md
- Examined the example output in result_example/document.md
- Analyzed the structure of the example docx file
- Established the project architecture with clearly defined components
- Created comprehensive documentation in docs/architecture.md

## Current Conversion Process Insights
- **Text Formatting**: Bold text in Word is converted to `**bold**` in Markdown
- **Heading Structure**: Bold paragraphs are treated as headings in Markdown
- **Image Handling**: Images from the docx are extracted and referenced in Markdown with the format `![alt_text](image_name.png)`
- **Image Naming**: Images are named sequentially (document.002.png, document.003.png, etc.)
- **Table Conversion**: Tables are converted to Markdown table syntax with proper alignment indicators (`:-)`)
- **Whitespace**: Double line breaks are used after headings and empty paragraphs

## Current Priorities
1. Implement the document model classes (Document, Paragraph, Image, Table)
2. Create the DocxParser with basic parsing functionality
3. Develop the MarkdownWriter with basic formatting support
4. Add image extraction and processing
5. Implement table conversion
6. Add ZIP archive creation functionality

## Active Decisions
- **Architecture Approach**: Using a three-component architecture with parser, document model, and writer
- **Document Model**: Creating a object-oriented representation of document elements (paragraphs, images, tables)
- **Parser Implementation**: Using python-docx to extract content from DOCX files
- **Bold Text Handling**: Treating paragraphs with bold text as headings
- **Image Processing**: Extracting and sequentially numbering images
- **Table Processing**: Converting tables to Markdown tables with proper alignment

## Open Questions
- How to handle complex nested lists
- Best approach for preserving complex table formatting
- Strategy for handling different text formatting combinations
- Approach for managing large documents efficiently
