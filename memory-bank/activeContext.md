# Active Context

## Current Focus
The MarkdownWriter implementation has been completed and successfully tested. We've implemented all the core functionality to convert document models to Markdown format, handle image extraction and saving, format text with proper Markdown syntax, and create ZIP archives with the correct structure. The entire conversion pipeline from Word documents to Markdown files is now functional.

## Recent Developments
- Implemented Document, Paragraph, Image, and Table model classes
- Created and tested the DocxParser with TDD approach
- Successfully parsed the example document
- Fixed table detection issue to preserve document flow
- Created special test scripts to verify table positioning
- Implemented the MarkdownWriter with full functionality
- Created test scripts to verify the conversion pipeline
- All tests pass with the updated implementation

## Parser Implementation Insights
- Heading detection based on bold text works effectively
- Tables are correctly parsed with rows and columns preserved in proper document flow
- Images are extracted with their binary content
- Text formatting information (bold, italic, etc.) is preserved in runs
- Document structure hierarchy is maintained
- Direct access to document body elements preserves exact ordering

## MarkdownWriter Implementation Insights
- Text formatting is properly converted to Markdown syntax (bold to **bold**, italic to *italic*, etc.)
- Images are extracted and saved in a media folder, with correct path references in Markdown
- Tables are converted to Markdown using pipe syntax with proper alignment
- Document structure is preserved with headings, paragraphs, and other elements
- Special characters are escaped in Markdown to prevent formatting issues
- ZIP archives are created with proper structure, containing the Markdown file and media folder

## Current Priorities
1. Implement error handling for edge cases
2. Enhance the command-line interface
3. Add more comprehensive testing
4. Complete documentation

## Active Decisions
- **Parser Implementation**: Using python-docx to extract content from DOCX files
- **Document Flow**: Processing paragraphs and tables in order by directly accessing document body elements
- **Heading Detection**: Treating paragraphs with bold text as headings
- **Image Processing**: Extracting and sequentially numbering images
- **Table Processing**: Converting tables to Markdown tables with proper alignment
- **Test-Driven Development**: Using pytest for unit testing the parser
- **Text Formatting**: Converting bold to `**bold**`, italic to `*italic*`, etc.
- **Heading Conversion**: Translating heading levels to corresponding Markdown headings
- **Image Handling**: Saving images in a media folder and referencing them with proper paths
- **Table Formatting**: Converting tables to Markdown using pipe syntax with proper alignments
- **ZIP Structure**: Organizing the output as a Markdown file and a media folder in a ZIP archive

## Next Steps
1. Implement error handling for edge cases (file access issues, malformed documents, etc.)
2. Enhance the command-line interface with better user feedback and options
3. Add more comprehensive testing for different document types and edge cases
4. Complete documentation including usage examples and API reference

## Current Conversion Process Insights
- **Document Flow**: Elements are processed in the exact order they appear in the source document
- **Text Formatting**: Bold text in Word is converted to `**bold**` in Markdown
- **Heading Structure**: Bold paragraphs are treated as headings in Markdown
- **Image Handling**: Images from the docx are extracted and referenced in Markdown with the format `![alt_text](image_name.png)`
- **Image Naming**: Images are named sequentially (document.002.png, document.003.png, etc.)
- **Table Conversion**: Tables are converted to Markdown table syntax with proper alignment indicators (`:-)`)
- **Whitespace**: Double line breaks are used after headings and empty paragraphs
- **Image Path Handling**: Images are saved in a media folder and referenced in Markdown using relative paths
- **Document Hierarchy**: All document elements are processed in the order they appear in the source
- **Escape Handling**: Special Markdown characters are escaped to prevent formatting issues
- **Archive Creation**: ZIP archives are created with proper structure for easy distribution

## Table Detection Fix
- Fixed the issue with table detection by modifying the parser to process document elements in flow order
- Tables are now correctly positioned in the parsed document structure
- Created specialized test scripts to verify table positions
- Direct access to the document body (`self.docx._body._body`) allows us to process elements in their natural order
- Modified `_process_document_elements` method to handle both paragraphs and tables as they appear
- Test confirmed tables appear at positions 15 and 18 in the parsed document, matching their actual positions in the document flow
