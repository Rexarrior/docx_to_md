# Active Context

## Current Focus
The DocxParser implementation is complete and tested. We've successfully implemented all model classes and the parser component of our architecture. The parser correctly extracts content from Word documents, including text formatting, headings, images, and tables. Our next step is to implement the MarkdownWriter to convert our document model to Markdown format.

## Recent Developments
- Implemented Document, Paragraph, Image, and Table model classes
- Created and tested the DocxParser with TDD approach
- Successfully parsed the example document
- Tested the parser with unit tests using pytest
- Analyzed the parsing results for correctness

## Parser Implementation Insights
- Heading detection based on bold text works effectively
- Tables are correctly parsed with rows and columns preserved
- Images are extracted with their binary content
- Text formatting information (bold, italic, etc.) is preserved in runs
- Document structure hierarchy is maintained
- All tests pass for the parser functionality

## Current Priorities
1. Implement the MarkdownWriter with basic formatting support
2. Add image saving functionality
3. Implement table conversion to Markdown format
4. Create the ZIP archive packaging
5. Add error handling and command-line interface

## Active Decisions
- **Parser Implementation**: Successfully using python-docx to extract content from DOCX files
- **Heading Detection**: Treating paragraphs with bold text as headings
- **Image Processing**: Extracting and sequentially numbering images
- **Table Processing**: Converting tables to Markdown tables with proper alignment
- **Test-Driven Development**: Using pytest for unit testing the parser

## Next Steps
1. Implement MarkdownWriter class with formatting methods
2. Create text formatting conversion (bold, italic to Markdown syntax)
3. Implement table conversion to Markdown format
4. Add image saving and referencing
5. Create ZIP archive functionality

## Current Conversion Process Insights
- **Text Formatting**: Bold text in Word is converted to `**bold**` in Markdown
- **Heading Structure**: Bold paragraphs are treated as headings in Markdown
- **Image Handling**: Images from the docx are extracted and referenced in Markdown with the format `![alt_text](image_name.png)`
- **Image Naming**: Images are named sequentially (document.002.png, document.003.png, etc.)
- **Table Conversion**: Tables are converted to Markdown table syntax with proper alignment indicators (`:-)`)
- **Whitespace**: Double line breaks are used after headings and empty paragraphs
